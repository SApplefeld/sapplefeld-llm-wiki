.SYNOPSIS
Creates a new knowledge base repo from the engine's template/ directory.

.DESCRIPTION
Instantiates a self-contained knowledge base: it copies the entire template/
tree (including dotfiles and dot-directories) into a fresh destination, runs
git init on the main branch, makes one initial commit, and verifies the result
with tests/Test-KbStructure.ps1 before reporting success. It refuses to touch a
destination that already holds files, so an existing repo is never overwritten.
It creates no git remote and assumes no GitHub account, because each owning
entity's git host and identity differ. It does not set git user.name or
user.email; the account's own git config owns the committer identity, and a
missing identity stops the run loudly rather than being papered over. On
success it prints the follow-up steps, leading with trusting the new workspace,
because Claude Code ignores permissions.allow in an untrusted workspace and a
scheduled run there silently writes nothing.

.PARAMETER Name
The name of the knowledge base. It is used only in the initial commit message.
An empty or whitespace-only name is rejected.

.PARAMETER Path
The destination directory to create as the KB repo root. It must not already
exist with contents. A relative path is resolved against the current location.

.EXAMPLE
pwsh -NoProfile -File ./new-kb.ps1 -Name "Eleos KB" -Path ../eleos-kb
